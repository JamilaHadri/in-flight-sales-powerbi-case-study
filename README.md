## Overview

This repository documents a real-world case study from my tenure as a Project Manager and Business Unit Manager at a subsidiary of Royal Air Maroc (pre-2020). It showcases the implementation of a customized Power BI dashboard to monitor and optimize in-flight sales indicators, transforming raw data into actionable insights for aviation retail performance.

**Key Highlights:**
- **Role**: Led the project, overseeing a freelance consultant from Serviar France who traveled to Morocco for on-site implementation and customization.
- **Challenge**: In-flight sales data was siloed across systems, leading to delayed insights and missed revenue opportunities.
- **Solution**: A tailored Power BI tool that visualized KPIs in real-time, enabling proactive decision-making.
- **Impact**: Improved sales tracking by 30% (fictionalized estimate based on typical outcomes), with dashboards adapted for mobile access during flights.

This "power case" is designed to inspire similar implementations in aviation, retail, or any performance-monitoring domain. It's creative in its narrative approach, blending technical details with storytelling to highlight how data-driven tools can "take off" business performance.

## Background

Before 2020, Royal Air Maroc's subsidiaries faced intense competition in the in-flight retail space. As a manager, I identified that our sales indicators—such as revenue per flight, product mix, and customer preferences—were not being monitored effectively. Data from point-of-sale systems, inventory logs, and passenger feedback was scattered, making it hard to spot trends like peak-selling times or underperforming routes.

Enter Power BI: We partnered with a freelance consultant from Serviar France, a French firm specializing in BI solutions. He flew to Morocco for a two-week sprint, customizing the tool to our needs. No off-the-shelf template would do—we needed aviation-specific metrics, like "sales uplift per seat" and "inventory turnover during turbulence" (a creative KPI I proposed to account for flight dynamics).

## Implementation Journey

### Phase 1: Data Integration
- Connected Power BI to our ERP systems (e.g., SAP) and in-flight POS data.
- Handled data cleansing for inconsistencies (e.g., currency conversions for international routes).

### Phase 2: Customization with Serviar France
- The consultant built custom visuals: A "Flight Revenue Heatmap" showing sales hotspots by seat class and time of flight.
- Added real-time alerts for low-stock items, integrated with flight crew tablets.
- Creative Twist: We gamified the dashboard with "Sales Altitude" meters—visual gauges that "climbed" as targets were met, boosting morale.

### Phase 3: Deployment and Training
- Rolled out to managers and crew via Power BI Service.
- Training sessions emphasized performance monitoring: How to drill down into data for root-cause analysis (e.g., why snacks sell better on long-haul flights?).

## Monitoring Performance: The Power Case

This case study adapts the tool for broader performance monitoring in dynamic environments like aviation. Key adaptations include:

- **KPIs Monitored**:
  - Revenue per Flight (RPF): Tracks total sales divided by flight duration.
  - Conversion Rate: Percentage of passengers making purchases.
  - Product Performance: Heatmaps for top-selling items (e.g., duty-free vs. snacks).
  - Trend Analysis: Month-over-month growth, with predictive elements using Power BI's AI features.

- **Creative Enhancements for Monitoring**:
  - **Scenario Planning**: Built-in "what-if" analyses (e.g., "What if we reduce prices by 10% on red-eye flights?").
  - **Mobile Optimization**: Dashboards designed for crew to access mid-flight, enabling real-time adjustments (e.g., promoting items based on live data).
  - **Sustainability Angle**: Monitored eco-friendly product sales to align with Royal Air Maroc's green initiatives.

- **Outcomes**:
  - Faster Decision-Making: Reduced time-to-insight from days to minutes.
  - Revenue Boost: Hypothetical 25-35% increase in targeted sales (based on industry benchmarks).
  - Scalability: The framework can be cloned for other airlines or retail sectors.
