# Implementation Guide: Power BI for In-Flight Sales

## Step-by-Step Process
1. **Assess Needs**: Identify KPIs (e.g., sales velocity = revenue / flight time).
2. **Data Sources**: Integrate with aviation APIs or databases.
3. **Customization**: Work with experts like Serviar France for tailoring.
4. **Testing**: Simulate flight scenarios in Power BI.
5. **Deployment**: Publish to cloud for mobile access.

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Challenge**: Data latency during flights.
- **Solution**: Offline syncing with real-time sync on landing.

## Creative Monitoring Tips
- Use Power BI's drill-through for "deep dives" (e.g., from route-level to individual sales).
- Integrate with IoT sensors for "smart cart" tracking in planes.
